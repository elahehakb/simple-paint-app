# Simple Paint App by Elaheh Akbarian

A simple Paint-like application written in Python using the `graphics.py` library.  
This project allows you to draw lines by dragging your mouse, change colors, adjust pen size, clear the canvas, and quit the program.  
It’s a fun way to practice Python graphics programming and create your own mini Paint app!

## Project Description

The Simple Paint App is designed to be a beginner-friendly project for learning Python graphics.  
It uses John Zelle’s `graphics.py` library to provide a basic drawing canvas.  
Users can interactively draw lines, change colors, adjust pen thickness, clear the canvas, and exit the program using keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Draw lines by **clicking and dragging the mouse**.
- Change pen color randomly with **`C`**.
- Increase/decrease pen size with **`+`** or **`-`**.
- Clear the canvas with **`X`**.
- Quit the program with **`Q`**.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Install the `graphics.py` library:

```bash
pip install graphics.py

> **Note:** `graphics.py` is John Zelle’s simple graphics library for Python.

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
python paint.py

## Controls

| Action | Key / Mouse |
